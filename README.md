* HuffmanCoding.java
* This program constructs a Huffman Tree based on character frequency data,
* then generates prefix codes for each character by traversing the tree.
* It supports encoding a text string into its Huffman-compressed binary form
* and decoding a binary Huffman string back into the original text. 
*
* The implementation includes:
*   - Building a Huffman Tree from a frequency table
*   - Generating prefix codes using recursive tree traversal
*   - Encoding input strings using the generated Huffman codes
*   - Decoding binary strings using the Huffman Tree
